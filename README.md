# House Pricing 

This was an assignment on Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course. I've already done the exercise in Octave, this project is to help me get familiar with the different libraries in Python.

## Problem

Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to first collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices.

## Data
The file **data.txt** contains a training set of housing prices in Port- land, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.

Here is the first ten entries of the data
| Size in Square Feet | No. of Bedrooms | Price  |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------ |
| 2104                | 3               | 399900 |
| 1600                | 3               | 329900 |
| 2400                | 3               | 369000 |
| 1416                | 2               | 232000 |
| 3000                | 4               | 539900 |
| 1985                | 4               | 299900 |
| 1534                | 3               | 314900 |
| 1427                | 3               | 198999 |
| 1380                | 3               | 212000 |
| 1494                | 3               | 242500 |

## Solution

It is best to explore the [HousePricing](./HousePricing.ipynb) for a detailed step-by-step on how to apply Linear Regression to this problem.
